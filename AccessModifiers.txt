Something you want to access outside the package make it public
Inside the same package the things are accessible private or public
but if you want to acces it outside the package you should make it public

Private--->
private variable or method are accessible inside the class
irrespective to the package

Deafult--> No mention any access modifier it is Deafult
It access in same package


Projected----> it can be access to it's sub-class and class it self
And also access in same package
and a class in other package and it is sub-class them the protected are accessible to that class.





============================

--> Try to make your classes public
--> Try to keep variable/ instance variable private, access to setter/getter
--> Methods most of the time are public where required
--> If variables are accessed to sub-class them make them protected
--> Avoid using the Deafult type of access modifier
