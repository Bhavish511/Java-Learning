--> contain multiple methods


Functional Interfaces --> Also called SAM (Single Abstract Method)-->

For example:
Serialization--> Is the concept to store the state or store or save the object on the drive,
and want again that so we can get.

Like--> we are playing the game and want to save the stats,
so we save the stats,

and after restart the values are zero's and now we can used the stored the object to get the same stats

--> again getting the object is called de-Serialization.

-> Every object doesn't not allow the de-Serialization, we have to give the permissions. by the help of marker interface.
